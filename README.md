# Rick and Morty Card Collector

# Brief Project Description 
The website is created in HTML, CSS and Native JavaScript. It is a final project for the Native Javascript course in frontend development at ITHS.

# Description 
The purpose of the website is to demonstrate skills in Native JavaScript, API fetching, and CRUD operations. The website consists of two parts: one part showcases the ability to fetch information from an API, and another part performs CRUD operations using an API provided by ITHS. Users should also be able to save information in local storage and utilize it. I chose to use the Rick and Morty API because the popular series has a lot of interesting characters. I decided to render these characters as cards that users can save in local storage.
